                <h2> What is Web 1.0?</h2>
                <p>Web 1.0 was the first version of the internet. This stage of the internet lasted from around 1991 to 2004
                     and is sometimes dubbed as "The Static Internet". The defining characteristic of this stage was that users
                     were mainly only able to view webpages, there weren't many options to log in sites, post content to certain
                      sites or have experiences personalized to you.

                <h2>What is Web 2.0?</h2>
                <p>Web 2.0 came directly after Web 1.0 and began around 2004. It is the stage of the internet that we are currently
                    in today and it is dubbed as "The Dynamic Internet". The defining characteristic of this stage is that users are
                    able to interact with and influence the pages that they visit. Users are able to leave comments, create accounts,
                    post content and even have their experience be personalized to them.

                <h2> What is Web 3.0?</h2>
                <p>Web 3.0 is the proposed successor to Web 2.0 and a concept that has gained a lot of popularity within the last few
                     years. This stage is dubbed as "The Decentralized Internet". Web 3.0 is described by one of it's founders as a
                     <q>decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain</q>. This is the biggest difference separating it from Web
                      2.0. Instead of connecting to a server to get it's data, Web3 relies on the blockchain. It relies on the 
                      blockchain for the data as well as to be decentralized and secure among other things.  </p>

                <h2> Criticisms of Web 3.0 </h2>
                <h3>The Blockchain is Law</h3>
                <p>One of the main concepts of blockchain technology is the idea of immutability. Changes that are made to the 
                    blockchain cannot be reversed unless the majority of the network agrees to do so for whatever reason. This 
                    is fine when dealing with transactions made on a network but when this concept is applied to things individuals
                     post online it becomes a lot more concerning. The phrase "the internet never forgets" becomes even more true in 
                     Web3. If an individual were to post something on a Web3 based platform, it would be impossible to get that 
                     content removed unless the person who posted it wanted it so. This means that a lot of content that are against
                      current platform terms of service could be free posted to a web3 platform without a way to remove it.
                       Allowing a way for the platform to remove the content would mean that the platform is centralized which
                        goes against one of the core principles of blockchain technology. This would make it just a more complicated
                         version of Web 2.0 </p>
                <h3>Interoperability Issues</h3>
                    <p> Although the internet today is not controlled by a singular company, there are a few companies that control a 
                        majority of the services and platforms available on the internet. Web 3.0 is supposed to solve this problem but
                    this is a problem that Web 3.0 also suffers from. There are 10s of smart contract blockchains that are all attempting
                    to build Web 3 platforms. These blockchains also don't have a lot of communication with each other and in some cases,
                    cannot even communicate with one another. Developers build Web 3 applications and platforms will have to either 
                    choose a singular blockchain on which to build this application or spend the necessary time to code and implement
                    their app on multiple chains.   </p>
                    <p>This issue becomes even greater when considering that Web3 isn't even the agreed upon Web2 successor among 
                        blockchain enthusiasts and developers. Recently another concept has been gaining a lot of popularity: Web5.
                    Web5 is extremely similar to Web3 except it is based only on the Bitcoin Network and believes that Web3.0 is a failure.
                    The biggest issue that this creates is that developers have to choose with ideology they agree with and since the Bitcoin
                    blockchain isn't interoperable with any other blockchain they are stuck with whatever choice they make. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Failed Vision</h3>
                <p>The biggest criticism of Web 3.0 is that it fails to live up to it's own goals. One of the main goals of Web 3.0 is to take
                     power away from the corporations and give it back to the people. This is achieved through decentralization and greater 
                     control of personal data. This fails however because of the nature of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies suffer from the 
                     Greater Fool Theory which results in early adopters getting a disproportionate amount of value from increasing investments. 
                     This is what has happened with Web 3.0. Large corporations have invested heavily in Web 3 platforms so they control a lot
                      of the platform and would receive a lot of the potential rewards. This means that a lot of the Web 3.0 platforms are 
                      actually centralized and aren't very different from the Web 2.0 platforms they are aiming to fix. </p>
